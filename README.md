QR codes — or "Quick Response" codes — are square-shaped barcodes that can be scanned by mobile devices. They are used for a variety of applications, from pulling up a restaurant menu to directing people to a podcast.

QR codes can also be used in wedding invitations to direct guests to the wedding website, where they can RSVP and find information on the venue, hotel options, and the registry.

Creating a QR code is a relatively straightforward process, and it can be done on a computer or on your smartphone. Here's how it's done.



## Create a QR code with QR Code Generator

There are many QR code generators to choose from. Here's a step-by-step guide using a website called QR Code Generator.

1. Using any web browser, go to the QR Code Generator website.
2. Enter the URL of the website you want the QR code to send people to. Alternatively, you can also enter text or upload a file (perhaps to a flyer you designed or to a restaurant menu).
3. When you're finished, click Download to save your custom QR code.
4. A pop-up will appear asking you to create a free account, but you don't have to create an account. Just wait for the QR code to finish generating and it will appear in your downloads as an image.
